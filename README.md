Sure, here is a README.md file for the Burger Bash SQL case study:

Burger Bash SQL Case Study
This case study uses SQL to analyze data about Burger Bash, a fictional burger restaurant. The case study asks a number of questions, such as:

What are the most popular burgers?
What are the most popular toppings?
What are the most popular days of the week for sales?
What are the most popular times of day for sales?
Where do most customers come from?
The case study uses SQL queries to answer these questions. For example, the following query finds the most popular burgers:

sql
SELECT burger_name, COUNT(*) AS number_of_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY burger_name
ORDER BY number_of_sales DESC

This query returns a table with the name of each burger and the number of times it has been sold. The burger with the most sales is at the top of the table.

The case study also uses SQL to create visualizations of the data. For example, the following query creates a bar chart of the most popular days of the week for sales:

sql
SELECT day_of_week, COUNT(*) AS number_of_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY number_of_sales DESC

This query returns a table with the day of the week and the number of sales on that day. The bar chart shows that Saturday is the most popular day for sales.

The case study is a good example of how SQL can be used to analyze data. The queries in the case study are relatively simple, but they can be used to answer a variety of questions about Burger Bash's sales data.
